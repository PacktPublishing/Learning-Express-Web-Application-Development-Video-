## About the Video Course
JavaScript is no longer limited to browsers! You can now build complete server-side web applications with Express.js. Developing web apps with Node will be faster and easier with the simple and straightforward Express framework.
This course will guide you through building a real-world web application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 
Youâ€™ll start with using the Jade template library and Bootstrap framework to create clean and maintainable code for your app. You will then see how to put MongoDB to work, store data for your app, and incorporate best-practices such as modularization. Youâ€™ll go beyond the basics to include authentication, test-driven-development, and powerful time-saving tools to get the app ready for deploying. You will also explore CSS preprocessors and create RESTful services that make the best of MVC libraries and add that extra edge to your app.
After completing this series, youâ€™ll be ready to start building and deploying web applications of your own.
